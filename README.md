## Unit Testing

Unit testing can be carried out by first starting the flask server with `python app.py` with `testing=true` set in the env. This will turn on the flask server to accept HTTP requests which is only used during testing. You'll also need [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/).

Once the flask server is running you can start the unit tests with `pytest` in the main directory and it will run through the tests that are in `test_app.py`
